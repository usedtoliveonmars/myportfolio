So lets start off with a little bit about myself. I was born and in [Aiken, SC][Aiken-SC] and was raised in [Winsor, SC][Windsor-SC]. The population was 121 in 2010, and didn't even have a stoplight. It is somehow part of the [Augusta, GA][Augusta-GA] metropolitan area. 

The Falcons were the local team but you wouldn't know if you asked around. Most people down there, and in SC in general didn't watch the NFL. Now college is a different story, SC is divided between Clemson and Carolina. Us Carolinians called it USC (University of South Carolina), not to be confused with University of Southern California. Which came after, just saying.

I became a fan in 2014, not sure what got me started with it honestly. But picking my team was easy, it just spoke it me. I looked at all the teams around Aiken, SC: Falcons, Panthers, Jaguars. Loved seeing the Falcons play, they are just an exciting team. Loved the team colors, and they just spoke to me. I was destined to become a Falcons fan.

I haven't missed a game yet, either live or rewatched. I love this team, and I honestly couldn't see myself rooting for any other team. I've invested a lot of time, money, and emotions to these Falcons. Even if my future self were to come back from the future and tell me the Falcons will never win a SuperBowl in my lifetime, I'd still be a fan. It's just loyalty and identity. The only thing I regret is that, to this day, I still haven't been to a home game.
